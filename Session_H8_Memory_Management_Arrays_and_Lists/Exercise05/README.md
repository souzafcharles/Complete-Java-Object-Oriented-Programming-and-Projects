# Exercise 05
**Instructions**: Write a program that reads N real numbers and stores them in a array. Then, display on the screen the largest number in the array (assume no ties). Also display the position of the largest element, considering the first position as 0 (zero).

### Example Inputs and Outputs

| **Input**                                     | **Output**                          |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `How many numbers are you going to enter? ` 6 | `LARGEST VALUE` = 14.0              |
| `Enter a number`: 8.0                         | `POSITION OF THE LARGEST VALUE` = 3 |
| `Enter a number`: 4.0                         |                                     |
| `Enter a number`: 10.0                        |                                     |
| `Enter a number`: 14.0                        |                                     |
| `Enter a number`: 13.0                        |                                     |
| `Enter a number`: 7.0                         |                                     |
