# Exercise 14
**Instructions**:

Write a program to read two integer numbers M and N, and then read an M x N matrix of integers, allowing for repetitions. Subsequently, read an integer number X that is present in the matrix. For each occurrence of X, display the values to the left, above, to the right, and below X, whenever they exist, as shown in the example.
