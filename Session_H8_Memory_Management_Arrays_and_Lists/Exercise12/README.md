# Exercise 12
**Instructions**: A homeowner of a boarding house has ten rooms available for rent to students, identified by the numbers 0 to 9.

Write a program that starts with all ten rooms empty, then reads a quantity N representing the number of students who will rent rooms (N can be from 1 to 10). Then, register the rental of the N students. For each rental registration, enter the student's name and email, as well as which of the rooms they chose (from 0 to 9). Assume that an empty room is chosen. In the end, your program should print a report of all the boarding house's occupancies, in order of room, as in the example.
