# Exercise 10
**Instructions**: Write a program to read a set of N student names, as well as the grades they got in the 1st and 2nd semesters. Each of these pieces of information should be stored in a array. Then, print the names of the approved students, considering approved those whose average grade is greater than or equal to 6.0 (six).

To solve this problem, you should create a CLASS according to the project alongside:

| **Studant**                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| - Name: `String`                                         |
| - gradeFirstSemester: `double`                           | 
| - gradeSecondSemester: `double`                          |
| =========================================                |
| + `calculateAverageGrade(): double`                      |
| + `showNameStudentApproved(students: Student[]): String` |
