# Exercise 01
**Instructions**:
Write a program to read the dollar exchange rate and then the amount in dollars to be purchased by a person in reais. Display the amount in reais that the person will pay for the dollars, considering that the person will have to pay a 6% IOF on the dollar amount. Create a `CurrencyConverter` class to be responsible for the calculations.
## Class Structure

| **CurrencyConverter**                  |
|----------------------------------------|
| - IOF_RATE: `final double = 0.06`      |
| ====================================== |
| + `convertDollarToReal()`              |

### Example Inputs and Outputs
