the name, hours worked, and hourly rate. Outsourced employees also have an additional expense. The employee's payment
corresponds to the hourly rate multiplied by the hours worked, and outsourced employees also receive a bonus

user) and store them in a list. After reading all the data, show 1 the name and payment of each employee in the same
order they were entered. Build the program according to the project on the bellow:
