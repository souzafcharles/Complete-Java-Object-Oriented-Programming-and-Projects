# Exercise02

**Instructions**: Write a program to read the data of N products (N provided by the user). At the end, display the price tag of each product in the same order they were entered. Every product has a name and price. Imported products have 1  an import tax, and used products have a manufacturing date. This specific data should be added to the price tag as shown in the example (next page). For imported products, the import tax should be added to the final product price. Please implement the program according to the attached project.
