# Problem Statement Exercise 01

**Instructions**: In an online course portal, each user has a unique code, represented by an integer.
Each instructor in the portal can have multiple courses, and the same student can enroll in as many courses as they
want. Thus, the total number of students for an instructor is not simply the sum of the students in all of their
courses, as there may be repeated students in more than one course.
Instructor Balthazar has three courses, A, B, and C, and wants to know his total number of students. Your program should
read the students of courses A, B, and C for instructor Alex, then display the total number of students.
